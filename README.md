# Blockchain Oracle Project

This project demonstrates how to connect a blockchain to the internet using an Oracle to fetch the live price of a token. It includes a Go script to interact with the Oracle and a Solidity smart contract to integrate the Oracle data into the blockchain.

# Introduction

In this project, we showcase a simple implementation of a blockchain Oracle that fetches the live price of a token. Oracles are essential for smart contracts as they provide external data to the blockchain.
